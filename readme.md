I will try to maintain this mod as much as possible and will leave a disclaimer if it becomes depricated or unusable__

How to download - Will update if it changes:
- First download the version you want or the UnModded.dll
- Now go to Steam and find Stick Fight the Game
- Click on the config gear
- Find where it says 'Browse Local File' and click it
- When inside the folder look for the StickFight_Data File or something like that
- Then find the Managed folder and open it and find CSharpAssembly.dll and delete it
- Name the modded or unmodded dll file to 'CSharpAssembly.dll' and put it in there in it's place
- Now restart Stick Fight the Game
- Done, the mod should now be installed
