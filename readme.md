Boom Boom Mushroom's Chaos Mod for Stick Fight the Game<br/>
I will try to maintain this mod as much as possible and will leave a disclaimer if it becomes depricated or unusable<br/>
If you have any suggestions or find any bugs please create an issue and report the bug or give your suggestion<br/>

How to mod the game yourself is on my YT Channel - https://youtu.be/y9dEt58vmUI<br/>
How to download - Will update if it changes:
- First download the version you want or the UnModded.dll
- Now go to Steam and find Stick Fight the Game
- Click on the config gear
- Find where it says 'Browse Local File' and click it
- When inside the folder look for the StickFight_Data File or something like that
- Then find the Managed folder and open it and find CSharpAssembly.dll and delete it
- Name the modded or unmodded dll file to 'Assembly-CSharp.dll' and put it in there in it's place
- Now restart Stick Fight the Game
- Done, the mod should now be installed

Possible pathway for Stick Fight is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\StickFightTheGame\StickFight_Data\Managed
